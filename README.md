# pseudoGen

Program's generalized concept:

    Take in a pseudo-code file
  
    Turn it into workable code

Logic concept:

    Input code file
  
    Input dictionary for customizing translation
  
    Pick format (initially, just java)
  
    Give output directory/file
  
    Indicate verbosity of program status
  
    Indicate whether or not to compile and run code (planned)
  
  
Current state:

    Reads in input file
  
    Reads in files used for search and replace operation (eventually code dictionary)
  
    Performs search and replace on given file (eventually translation into code)
  
    Runs through combinations of replace (could be useful for a more condensed code option)
  
    Creates and maintains a directory of output files (could be useful for the above to see all varieties)
  
    Accepts user input through command line (eventually through GUI)
